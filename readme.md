### A simple Angular + Typescript application VS2015 solution base

The solution has 3 projects:

1. ASP.NET WebApi project (**WebAPI - basically a dummy**)

2. ASP.NET WebSite project (**WebApplication**)

3. Generated WebSite (**BuiltAngularApp**)

The last one is not really a project but added as an existing website to the solution and is effectively the output of the WebApplication to BuiltAngularApp -directory. It is, in effect, a clean HTML5 + JS website (clean folder with nothing extra) and could even be used as the input (www-directory contents) for a mobile Cordova app.


This solution is an example structure of what a solution could look like and contains the Typescript examples for all major AngularJS components along with a working naming and structuring scheme.
